# Calculator-Project

Hello this is my calculator project.

Day 1 12:00AM (1/18/2022): Laying out some buttons and display visual and pre-assigning class and id selectors to button. 

Day 2 9:51AM (1/18/2022) : Laid out all the button for now and added a mouseover color change effect for each button.

    1:45PM  : Assign quereySelector to all the buttons

    2:15PM : numbers(operands) and sign(operators) show up on display when buttons are pressed.
    
        -note: I have to somehow assign numbers and operators to a variable, so i can later add,subtract,multiply, and divide with two numbers.
        (difficult javascript parts now)

    2:34PM : Write basic math logic in js file in comments form.

    3:16PM : gonna have to review old lessons to figure out some logical stuff.

    4:06PM : basic variables set for now. Not sure if i am doing it correctly but i hope to understand how to assign math properties to it. (total result, number 1, number 2, and operator)

    5:01PM: add function operator formulas.
            - a + b
            - a - b
            - a * b
            - a / b
