# Calculator-Project

Hello this is my calculator project.

Day 1 12:00AM (1/18/2022): Laying out some buttons and display visual and pre-assigning class and id selectors to button. 

Day 2 9:51AM (1/18/2022) : Laid out all the button for now and added a mouseover color change effect for each button.

    1:45PM  : Assign quereySelector to all the buttons

    2:15PM : numbers and operators show up on display when buttons are pressed.
    
        -note: I have to somehow assign numbers and operators to a variable, so i can later add,subtract,multiply, and divide with two numbers.
        (difficult javascript parts now)
